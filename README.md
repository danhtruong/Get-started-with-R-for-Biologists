# Introduction 

This repository contains resources on getting started with R for biologists. [R](https://www.r-project.org) is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used for a variety of statistical analysis (i.e., linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, clustering, etc.). R is freely available and has a large collection of developed packages of different tools. One such is the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org), which is a collection of data science tools.
